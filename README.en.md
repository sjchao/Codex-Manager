## Source Notes
> This project was built under my direction with AI assistance: Codex (98%) and Gemini (2%). If you run into issues while using it, please communicate in a friendly way. I open-sourced it because I thought it could help someone, and the core functionality is already usable.
> I also do not have enough environments to verify every package on every platform. I still have a day job, and I cannot afford devices like Macs, so I only guarantee availability for the Windows desktop app. If there are issues on other platforms, please report them in the community group or submit Issues after sufficient testing. I will handle them when I have time.
> Finally, thanks to everyone who reported platform-specific issues in the group and helped with part of the testing.

## Recent Changes
  - Current latest version: `v0.1.15` (2026-04-03)
  - This release mainly closes out around two themes: streaming gateway stability and account operation UX. It fixes cases where tool-call arguments could be overwritten, dropped, or cleared by empty `edits` during OpenAI -> Anthropic SSE bridging, and it also aliases `chat.completion` usage fields to OpenAI `prompt/completion tokens`, making tool calls and usage stats more reliable.
  - Error reporting has been tightened up as well: upstream raw error messages are preserved whenever possible, stream disconnects are surfaced with a clearer "network jitter" style message, and noisy or misleading log prompts are reduced to make troubleshooting easier.
  - The Accounts page now supports exporting only selected accounts, usage refresh account switching is smoother, and abbreviated token counts now consistently keep two decimal places across the dashboard, logs, and platform key pages.
  - This round of release alignment is also complete: the workspace, frontend package, Tauri desktop app, runtime guide, and README version notes have all been unified to `0.1.15`.

### Recent Commit Summary
- `be73359`: adjusted abbreviated token displays to keep two decimal places for more stable number formatting across dashboard, logs, and platform key pages.
- `dfb4494`: merged PR #86, which consolidates fixes for Anthropic SSE tool-call argument compatibility during streaming bridge conversion.
- `981bc6e`: aliased `chat.completion` usage fields to OpenAI `prompt/completion tokens`, reducing usage accounting mismatches.
- `480f847`: fixed a case where empty `edits` in completed events could overwrite streamed edit arguments.
- `7bbc5fc`: fixed `chat/completions` SSE handling so completed tool arguments are merged correctly even when content is non-empty.
- `aa2c09c`: merged streamed tool arguments before Anthropic SSE conversion to avoid losing arguments at completion time.
- `29c3b6b`: prevented placeholder tool arguments from wiping real streamed edit payloads, further hardening streaming tool-call stability.
- `c1844b7`: standardized stream disconnect messaging to a clearer network-jitter style prompt.
- `a89cd9c`: preserved upstream raw error text and tightened log messaging to make real failures easier to diagnose.
- `8d619a0`: added export-for-selected-accounts support and improved account switching during usage refresh.

## Feature Overview
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes, ban detection, and banned-account filtering
- Bulk import / export: supports multi-file import, recursive JSON folder import on desktop, and single-file export per account
- Usage display: supports both 5-hour + 7-day dual windows and accounts that only return a 7-day single window, with the corresponding reset times shown
- Authorized login: browser authorization plus manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding, reasoning effort, and service tier (`Follow Request` / `Fast` / `Flex`)
- Aggregate API: manage third-party minimal relay upstreams, with create, edit, connectivity testing, provider name, sort priority, and grouped display by Codex / Claude
- Plugin center: route at `/plugins/`, supports built-in curated, enterprise private, and custom-source market modes, and provides plugin lists, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration interfaces
- Settings page: supports the `System Derive` button, single-account concurrency limit, and a more conservative high-concurrency degradation strategy
- System internal interface inventory: lists all currently available desktop commands, service RPC methods, and plugin built-in functions
- Local service: auto-start, customizable port, and listen address
- Local gateway: provides one unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint for CLI tools and third-party tooling

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to `Account Management`, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL to complete parsing manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Default Data Directory
- By default, the desktop app writes the SQLite database to the app data directory, with the fixed filename `codexmanager.db`.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\com.codexmanager.desktop\\codexmanager.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- If you need to adjust the database, proxy, listen address, or other runtime configuration, continue with [Environment Variables and Runtime Configuration](docs/report/环境变量与运行配置说明.md).

## Page Overview
### Desktop App
- Account Management: centrally import, export, and refresh accounts and usage, with low-quota / banned filters and reset-time display
- Platform Keys: bind platform keys by model, reasoning effort, and service tier, and view invocation logs
- Plugin Center: `/plugins/` route with built-in curated / enterprise private / custom-source market switching, plugin install, enable/disable, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration
- Settings: centrally manage ports, listen address, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: provides a local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: provides a browser management interface
- `codexmanager-start`: launches service + web with one command
