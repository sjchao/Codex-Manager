## Source Notes
> This project was built under my direction with AI assistance: Codex (98%) and Gemini (2%). If you run into issues while using it, please communicate in a friendly way. I open-sourced it because I thought it could help someone, and the core functionality is already usable.
> I also do not have enough environments to verify every package on every platform. I still have a day job, and I cannot afford devices like Macs, so I only guarantee availability for the Windows desktop app. If there are issues on other platforms, please report them in the community group or submit Issues after sufficient testing. I will handle them when I have time.
> Finally, thanks to everyone who reported platform-specific issues in the group and helped with part of the testing.

## Recent Changes
  - Current latest version: `v0.1.18` (2026-04-06, release)
  -  the local gateway now has stronger Gemini CLI compatibility. Requests can be relayed to `/v1/responses`, with Gemini SSE streaming, permission confirmation, tools, MCP, and skill call chains handled end-to-end.
  -  fixed a Gemini `response.completed` issue where tool output could be misclassified as the final assistant message, reducing cases like `已修改 Desktop\\gemini.txt。` leaking into the final reply.
  -  fixed a token-refresh polling boundary issue. The scheduler now prefetches tokens that will enter the refresh window before the next poll cycle, reducing edge misses when both the poll interval and the refresh-ahead window are `600s`.
  - Request logs now distinguish between the client-explicit service tier and the effective service tier that actually goes upstream after platform-key overrides, so `auto` no longer obscures whether a default `Fast` setting was really applied.
  - Regular platform keys now use a wildcard-compatible protocol mode for Codex and Claude Code. The gateway routes `/v1/messages*` with Claude semantics and other standard paths with Codex / OpenAI semantics, so separate keys are no longer required for those clients.
  - The settings page now includes model forward rules with `pattern=target` syntax, for example `spark*=gpt-5.4-mini`. Platform-key bound models still take precedence over global forwarding rules.
  - The account-page quota detail popup has also been realigned so it now sits on the vertical midpoint of the quota overview card, making the 5-hour, 7-day, and extra quota details feel anchored to the correct hover target instead of floating too high.
  - Version alignment for this round is complete too: the workspace, frontend package, Tauri desktop app, lockfile, README, and CHANGELOG have all been updated to `0.1.18`.

### Recent Commit Summary
- `f4a03df`: fixed a Gemini completed-event issue where tool output could be mistaken for the final assistant message.
- `2d3b583`: fixed Gemini CLI SSE tool-call compatibility and strengthened `/v1/responses`, tools, MCP, and skill support.
- `a2c0e05`: switched platform-key protocol handling to wildcard path-based routing and added global model forwarding rules.
- `4389764`: added effective service-tier logging so request logs now separate client-explicit and actually applied values.
- `83bdb96`: expanded account-page and usage-modal quota rendering so refreshes now surface both standard and extra quota windows.
- `41375a4`: added `/v1/responses` WebSocket request support and transport-aware request logging.
- `b762a65`: fixed `service_tier` log semantics and added raw client-side `service_tier` diagnostics for both HTTP and WebSocket requests.
- `7e7b76f`: separated leftover formatting-only changes into their own cleanup commit.
- `be73359`: adjusted abbreviated token displays to keep two decimal places for more stable number formatting across dashboard, logs, and platform key pages.
- `dfb4494`: merged PR #86, which consolidates fixes for Anthropic SSE tool-call argument compatibility during streaming bridge conversion.
- `981bc6e`: aliased `chat.completion` usage fields to OpenAI `prompt/completion tokens`, reducing usage accounting mismatches.
- `480f847`: fixed a case where empty `edits` in completed events could overwrite streamed edit arguments.
- `7bbc5fc`: fixed `chat/completions` SSE handling so completed tool arguments are merged correctly even when content is non-empty.
- `aa2c09c`: merged streamed tool arguments before Anthropic SSE conversion to avoid losing arguments at completion time.
- `29c3b6b`: prevented placeholder tool arguments from wiping real streamed edit payloads, further hardening streaming tool-call stability.
- `c1844b7`: standardized stream disconnect messaging to a clearer network-jitter style prompt.
- `a89cd9c`: preserved upstream raw error text and tightened log messaging to make real failures easier to diagnose.
- `8d619a0`: added export-for-selected-accounts support and improved account switching during usage refresh.

## Feature Overview
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes, ban detection, and banned-account filtering
- Bulk import / export: supports multi-file import, recursive JSON folder import on desktop, and single-file export per account
- Usage display: supports the standard 5-hour + 7-day windows, 7-day-only accounts, and extra quota windows such as Code Review / Spark, with refreshes showing each window's remaining percentage and reset time
- Authorized login: browser authorization plus manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding, reasoning effort, and service tier (`Follow Request` / `Fast` / `Flex`)
- Aggregate API: manage third-party minimal relay upstreams, with create, edit, connectivity testing, provider name, sort priority, and grouped display by Codex / Claude
- Plugin center: route at `/plugins/`, supports built-in curated, enterprise private, and custom-source market modes, and provides plugin lists, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration interfaces
- Settings page: supports the `System Derive` button, single-account concurrency limit, and a more conservative high-concurrency degradation strategy
- System internal interface inventory: lists all currently available desktop commands, service RPC methods, and plugin built-in functions
- Local service: auto-start, customizable port, and listen address
- Local gateway: provides one unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and third-party tooling; Gemini requests can be relayed to `/v1/responses` with SSE, tools, MCP, and skill compatibility

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to `Account Management`, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL to complete parsing manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Default Data Directory
- By default, the desktop app writes the SQLite database to the app data directory, with the fixed filename `codexmanager.db`.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\com.codexmanager.desktop\\codexmanager.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- If you need to adjust the database, proxy, listen address, or other runtime configuration, continue with [Environment Variables and Runtime Configuration](docs/report/环境变量与运行配置说明.md).

## Page Overview
### Desktop App
- Account Management: centrally import, export, and refresh accounts and usage, with low-quota / banned filters and reset-time display
- Platform Keys: bind platform keys by model, reasoning effort, and service tier, and view invocation logs
- Plugin Center: `/plugins/` route with built-in curated / enterprise private / custom-source market switching, plugin install, enable/disable, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration
- Settings: centrally manage ports, listen address, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: provides a local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: provides a browser management interface
- `codexmanager-start`: launches service + web with one command
